# Capstone-Presentation

This project analyzes SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to explore factors influencing mission success. Data was collected via the SpaceX REST API and Wikipedia web scraping, then cleaned, transformed, and analyzed. Exploratory analysis revealed trends in payloads, launch sites, orbits, and success rates, with the Decision Tree Classifier delivering the best predictive performance.

## Key Findings
- Higher launch frequencies at a site correlate with higher success rates.

- Launch success rates steadily increased from 2013 to 2020.

- Orbits such as ES-L1, GEO, HEO, SSO, and VLEO achieved the highest success rates.

- KSC LC-39A had the most successful launches overall.

- Almost all missions in recent years were successful.
